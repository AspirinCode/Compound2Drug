## Introduction
A network data is composed of nodes and edges. An example of such network data would be social network data where nodes are people and their interests and edges are interconnections between them[2-5]. Many useful applications such as customized suggestions for
social media users have been developed through the use of Machine/Deep learning algorithms which accomplish this through node classification and link prediction protocols.
